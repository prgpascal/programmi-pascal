## What's this?
It's a collection of programs written in [Pascal][3].  
All source codes can be studied and downloaded for free.  
The description of each exercise is available [here][1].

## FAQ
- **Question 1**: Hey, I've read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), and these programs seem written by a buddy who has no programming skills!
  - I've read it too, and I think it's an excellent book!! And you're right, but I wrote these programs in 2008 when I was 16 and had no programming skills :-)
- **Question 2**: Can you help me solving an exercise?
  - I'm sorry, but I have not enough time :-(
- **Question 3**: Where are the source codes of the games?
	- I'm sorry but a few years ago I definitively lost all the source codes of the games. Actually you can only try them, downloading the executable files.
