**Attenzione:** Questa Ã¨ la versione inglese del  file README.md. Puoi trovare la versione in italiano [qui](README.md).

## What's this?
It's a collection of programs written in [Pascal][3].  
All source codes can be studied and downloaded for free.  
The description of each exercise is available on [programmipascal.it][1].

## FAQ
- **Question 1**: Hey, I've read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), and this programs seem written by a dummy who has no programming skills!
  - I've read it too and I think it's a really good book!! And you're right, but I wrote these programs on 2008, when I was 16 and had no programming skills :-)
- **Question 2**: Can you help me solving an exercise?
  - I'm sorry, but I have not enough time :-(
- **Question 3**: I've new programs, can I add them?
  - Sure :-) You can *push* your programs on a new *branch* and open a *merge request*.  Please send the description of the exercise [here][2]. I'll add your name and the exercise on [programmipascal.it][1] too.
- **Question 4**: Where are the source codes of the games?
	- I'm sorry but few years ago I definitively lost all the source codes of the games. Actually you can only try them, downloading the executable files.
